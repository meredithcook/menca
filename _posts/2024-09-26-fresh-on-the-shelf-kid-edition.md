I'm starting something new, but sporadic, on the blog today. While I don't keep up with new books very often, every once in a while I will have new books to share with you. Today is one such day, and I'm excited to share three new kids books with you. (Disclaimer: both of these authors are friends of mine, so while these aren't full, unbiased reviews, I have read all three books and can vouch for them!)
