At a routine dermatologist appointment, the doctor making the requisite small talk found out that I'm a grant writer. She admitted that she is a terrible writer and speller, though I'm not sure I totally believed her. Then she asked me a question I'm not sure I've been asked before, though you'd think that given writing is both my profession and primary hobby, I'd have been asked by now. 

She was curious to know if, and how, I used AI in my writing. I gave her a quick answer, but I've been mulling over the question ever since. 

The short answer is, I very rarely use AI, for a few reasons. 

First, because I work for an educational institution, there is an AI policy I follow, and happily so. I never want to use AI to do my job for me--primarily for the sake of honoring the people and foundations I work with by putting in the time and effort to create quality grant proposals and reports that truly represent our school. I think, for the sake of my own integrity and the school I work for, that it's important for me to do my own work. 

Second, I don't use AI frequently because I actually enjoy writing. There are days where it's hard. I'm not a great thinker, and "writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is" (a quote attributed to cartoonist Richard Guindon). However, to use AI to help me write would do to me what smartphones have done to most of us--weaken our cognitive function. Though designed to enhance learning and be helpful, using AI in my writing would atrophy my writing muscles, decreasing my ability to actually do it well on my own.

Third, and perhaps most silly, I am increasingly suspicious of new technology. I think I'm just an old lady at heart. I've never been one to geek out on new tech and I've certainly never been an early adopter--quite the opposite, in fact. Though I don't fear that AI will completely take over jobs like mine, I simply am not excited about technology that can replace humans, in any capacity.

All that said, I do use AI for certain use cases and find it helpful and even fun sometimes. Here are four ways I use AI.

**1. I use AI to help me brainstorm.** Most of the articles on this site I write on a whim--it's whatever I've been thinking about, learning, or find interesting to write about. However, there are times when I come up short, so I will occasionally ask an AI bot to help me brainstorm article ideas or create a content calendar for this site. 

**2. I use AI as a better search engine.** Sometimes, I need a metaphor or example in my writing but my mind goes blank. In the past, I would google a generic description of what I was looking for, but AI has made that easier. For example, in the example above of how smartphones have weakened our cognitive function, I asked AI for an example of technology that was designed to be helpful but actually weakened cognitive function. Ironic, I guess. 

I also will frequently skim the AI search results from a generic search engine before scrolling the actualy list of results. It's helpful to see how AI has summarized the information I'm looking for and choose the website that seems most helpful without spending so much time scrolling or clicking on search results, only to come up short.

**3. I use AI to help me generate a message.** Once or twice, I have used AI to help me generate an email for work (this is within the acceptable use policy) to ensure clear communication. I always edit these messages myself, but AI has been helpful for brevity and clarity when I'm struggling with both. I also use AI almost like I would a thesaurus. Sometimes, I just come up short on a word or phrase in my writing and need help finding a better word. This has come up when all I can think of are words with negative connotations and want to put a more positive spin on it. Or, if I need to write something that, written carelessly, would come across poorly, then I will type what I want to say in AI and ask it to make it sound more polite. 

For example, this past year, we started a tradition with our kids to use their birthday parties as a way to be generous. Instead of getting a bunch of presents from the 15-20+ kids at their party, we talked with our kids about the importance of being generous...and reminded them that they would still get plenty of gifts from family members. The kids agreed to using their birthday party as a way to collect food for our church's food pantry. However, it's really hard to explain this well on a birthday invitation. So, we had AI write up a couple of sentences explaining what we were doing and from what I can tell, it went over well with the parents who brought their kids to the party.

**4. I use AI to create images.** Canva has a great AI design tool that my husband and I recently discovered. I am currently testing it out on creating header images for this blog. I typically use Unsplash, but occasionally I can't find quite what I'm looking for in a header image. Today's blog post was a good excuse to try it out. 

I have used AI to create fun cartoons that look like my kids. Recently, I was designing my son's birthday party invitation. He wants a superhero theme, so I used Canva's AI image generator to create a cartoon superhero that looks like him. See below!
