A more random assortment for you this month. I supposed I clicked on enough random headlines that the algorithm began showing me content beyond my typical reading. Enjoy!

### [5 Things You Should Know About Biblical Decision Making](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/5-things-decision-making?ck_subscriber_id=2579730862&utm_source=convertkit&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Redeeming%20Productivity%20#169%20-%2014158927){:target="_blank"}

Making decisions—particularly big ones—is often paralyzing to someone like me. So I always appreciate helpful reminders about how to seek the Lord's wisdom in decision making. The advice in this article is reminiscent of the classic, *[Experiencing God](https://amzn.to/3AerJaS){:target="_blank"}*, which I highly recommend if you're looking for a book-length treatment with a similar theme.

### [Theological Discernment is for Moms Too](https://laradentremont.substack.com/p/theological-discernment-is-for-moms){:target="_blank"}

For the seminary-trained and non-seminary-trained mother, a quote from this article applies to each: "While we teach and discern, we can rest knowing that the major work of heart change [in our children] isn’t our responsibility but God’s." Praise God for that. I'm immensely grateful for my seminary training and would encourage anyone who has the opportunity to take seminary classes to do so. It's informed so much of how I teach my kids about the gospel. That said, the writer of this article is right when she points out that the source and foundation of wisdom for all believers is God's word and the Holy Spirit. It is this foundation by which we raise our kids to know and love God.

### [I Was Trapped in Quicksand for 12 Hours in a Blizzard](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/i-was-trapped-in-quicksand-for-12-hours-in-a-blizzard?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us){:target="_blank"}

I blame Looney Tunes for the fact that I grew up believing that quicksand would be a much bigger problem for me than it actually was. However, this article confirmed that quicksand is, in fact, a big problem when you come upon it. This was quite the thrilling read and only solidified my deep respect for quicksand.

### [How to be a Norwegian parent: let your kids roam free, stay home alone, have fun – and fail](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jul/11/how-to-be-a-norwegian-parent-let-your-kids-roam-free-stay-home-alone-have-fun-and-fail?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us){:target="_blank"}

I'm fascinated by how other cultures raise their children, so of course this article caught my eye and sucked me in. While it lines up with much of what I've read about the value of giving kids independence and responsibility, I know that there are ditches we can fall in on either side of this discussion. Add in cultural norms, government policies, social media influence, suburban sprawl, and it's near impossible for Americans to raise our kids in ways similar to what this article describes. However, I always think it's good to observe what other cultures do and seek to learn from them.

At the risk of sounding like a super-narcissist, I think this article was written specifically for me. I bought the [author's book](https://amzn.to/4fsA8aX){:target="_blank"} after reading this article.

*"God knows your frame and the particular limitations that he has given you...He knows the constraints that keep you from doing all the good you feel like you ought to do, and rather than condemn, he shows compassion to you."*

### [It's OK to Be OK](https://caseymccall.com/its-ok-to-be-ok/){:target="_blank"}

This article describes the trickle-down effect of normalizing therapy-speech, particularly within the church and even more specifically, within church small groups. While a bit anecdotal, I do believe the article is warranted and a helpful read for those who are in church leadership.

### [Cognitive Decline and Common Faults](https://www.challies.com/articles/cognitive-decline-and-common-faults/){:target="_blank"}

Though this article is a specific reflection on aging ministers, I found it to be an encouraging reminder of God's sustaining grace, even in old age.

I have a lot of thoughts about the moral of this story, for which there is not room to list here. However, it's a fascinating story and worth the read.
