  <br>This month's new book (ok, not brand newâ€”it came out in August), is <i>The Sending Church Applied</i> by Bradley Bell, Mike Easton, Larry McCrary, and Nathan Sloan (and co-edited by yours truly). I've had the privilege of knowing all of these men for years and can vouch for their passion and ability to help local churches become the kind that send missionaries well. <i>Sending Church Applied</i> is the practical, how-to follow up to Bradley's first book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3AYfRun" target="blank"><i>The Sending Church Defined</i></a>. It's all things realted to, you guessed it, becoming a sending church: from building a sending strategy, to creating a missionary pipeline, to supporting missionaries while they're on the field, and receiving them well upon their return. If you're a pastor who's trying to figure out how to send more missionaries out of your church, I highly recommend this book (and not just because I edited it!).
