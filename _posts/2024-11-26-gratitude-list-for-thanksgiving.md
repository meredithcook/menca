It's so easy to blow past Thanksgiving when everyone and everything around us is already prepped for Christmas. But this year, I've tried more purposefully to cultivate a grateful heart and dwell on all of the things I am thankful for this year. Before the Christmas rush truly begins, it's nice to slow down and reflect on the Lord's blessings. 

Before I begin, I hope this doesn't read as just a brag sheet on how great my life is. Rather, my intention is to recognize that all things come from the Lord, who gives good gifts to His children. My hope is that this will encourage you to dwell on all you have to be thankful for, too.

Here are just a few of the things I'm thankful for this year:

1. For kids who still run around the house in costumes. Our time with them as littles is rapidly dwindling, and moments when they run into my office dressed as a princess or Paw Patrol or construction worker are becoming more and more precious.

2. That my kids love each other. I was afraid with the oldest going to kindergarten that they'd grow apart a bit. But, while they fight like all siblings do, they're still each other's best friend and their relationship is so sweet.

3. For two sets of believing parents. Even in our seminary world, we cannot assume our friends come from Christian families. It has made us even more thankful that we were raised by faithful Christians who are now helping us teach our kids about Jesus.

4. Related, for my legacy of faith. I can trace back at least to my great grandparents generations of faithful believers, many of whom are now seeing Christ face to face. 

5. For my husband. I don't know a more godly, patient, and selfless person and I'm so thankful I get to be married to him.  

6. For the Lord's sustaining grace and for His word. I began memorizing Scripture a couple of months ago and I can't recommend it enough. I wish I had started sooner.

7. For multi-generational friendships. For a long time, our community was made up primarily of people in our own stage of life. And while that had its benefits, I'm so thankful to be in community with people of varying life stages. I'm learning so much from them.

8. For the privilege of being able to write and publish [*Go Tell Everyone.*](https://amzn.to/4fJ0dCj) It was a book years in the making and it's still so surreal to see it sitting on my bookshelf. I'm thankful for the encouragement of those who have read and enjoyed it.

9. For our home. This year, I have felt more burdened and anxious about maintaining our home and keeping it clean, so I'm trying to dwell on what a blessing from the Lord this house isâ€”from how we even came to live in it to the revolving door of family, friends, and students who pass through. It's such a blessing to have a home we can use to serve and minister to people.

10. That my husband has finished his PhD. Halleluyah, praise the Lord.

11. For a job that allows me stay home with my kids. While the nature of my job lends itself to remote work, I realize that doesn't mean I'm entitled to work from home. I'm so grateful to work in an environment that values family and shows me so much grace and understanding so that I can both work and be present with my kids at home. 

12. For our church. For opportunities to serve, to lead, to disciple others, and knowing that if we need something, we could text no less than 25 people and our need would be met.
