*Note: Periodically I'll post book reviews to serve as a resource for readers looking for recommendations. I plan to include books for adults as well as kids' books. Very few of these reviews will be on new releases. If you're like me and are about two to three years behind on your reading, then this section is for you! You can find other book reviews [here](https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#book-review).*

<br> 
Teresa Joyelle Krager
<br>
B&H Kids, 2023
<br>
<br>
<b>Summary</b>
<br>
<i>The Greatest Book Ever</i> is a book about the <i>actual</i> greatest book ever, the Bible! Krager's book outlines stories of heroes (or anti-heroes) and their adventures, kings and queens, important battles, floods, miracles, and of course, good news for the whole worldâ€”all of which are contained in God's word. <i>The Greatest Book Ever</i> refers to forty Bible stories through catchy rhymes, all the while pointing kids to the greatest story ever: the gospel of Jesus Christ. Krager encourages kids ages four to eight to read God's word for themselves to find out more about the stories listed in her book.
<br>
<b>Review</b>
<br>
In <i>The Greatest Book Ever</i>, Teresa Joyelle Krager somehow manages to illustrate how Bible stories both stand alone as testaments to God's character and sustaining grace throughout redemptive history, while still illustrating that Scripture is a grand narrative that ultimately points to Christ. The book is chock-full of references to Bible stories in the Old Testament and then turns its focus to Jesus for the remainder of the book. Though the book lacks any references to New Testament stories past Jesus, it is ultimately a celebration of Scripture with vibrant, adorable illustrations and easy-to-read rhymes that make it an enjoyable read aloud for parents and kids alike.
<br>
<b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
<li>After <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/review-charlie-and-the-preschool-prodigal"><i>Charlie and the Preschool Prodigal</i></a>, this is probably my kids' favorite out of the <a href= "https://amzn.to/3wNxKd3" target= "blank"><i>TGC Kids</i></a> book series. They enjoy pointing out the "easter eggs" of characters from other books in the series. (Arlo, of <a href= "https://amzn.to/3PhGxKG" target= "blank"><i>Arlo and the Great Big Cover-Up</i></a> shows up in the background of this one and Lucy shows up in <i>Charlie and the Preschool Prodigal</i>.)</li> 
<br>
<li>In this season with my kids, <i>Lucy and the Saturday Surprise</i> is the book I've called back to most often when talking to my kids about their character. It helps to have a tangible example from a book they love when they're struggling with lying or jealousy.</li> 
<br>
<li>I like that the book emphasized confession as an important part of turning from coveting, and not just confession to God but confession to the person you wronged through your coveting. There is freedom in bringing sin to light in the community of fellow believers. </li> 
<br>
<li>I appreciate that these books also show positive examples of how we should respond when someone does something wrong. For example, Lucy's dad helps her understand her own actions, graciously corrects her, and encourages her to do the right thing by confessing to Lewis what she had done. Likewise, Lewis is gracious in his response and gives kids an example of how they should respond when someone wrongs them.</li> 
</ul>
<b>Cons:</b>
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>I'm not convinced that the book defines the word "coveting" in a way that really makes sense to kids. I frequently feel like I need to simplify the language even further for my kids, even though they're both within the age range for this book.</li>
<br>
<li>As I mentioned in my review of <i>Charlie and the Preschool Prodigal</i>, I appreciate the "Note to Grown-Ups," but I think these books would benefit from a few discussion questions for parents who might not know how to help their kids critically think about the principals in this book.</li>
</ul> 
<br>
<b>Who Should Read This Book:</b>
<br>
	This book is a helpful resource for parents and teachers of preschool-age children who desire to instill biblical truths in their kids in a compelling way. Christian parents of young children are most likely to pick up this book and read it to their kids.

<b>Favorite Quotes:</b>
<br>
<i>"When you feel envy toward someone, it's best to confess what you are feeling to someone you trust."</i>
