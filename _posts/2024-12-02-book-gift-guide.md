We are always happy to buy our kids books anytime of the year, and often buy a stack of new books for them to open on Christmas Eve. Here is a list of what I think are the best books to gift to young kids and adults (because I have no idea what kids between the ages of 8 and 18 read). 

These are organized by category first, but generally ascend in age group as you scroll down. All images are linked to the Amazon listing for each book.

# For the Kids
## Christmas-Themed Books

I buy [*Sounding Joy*](https://amzn.to/3CTEDwp) for every baby shower I go to. It is probably my all-time favorite kids book. Maybe I'm overplaying it, but I just love it so much. [*Share the Joy*](https://amzn.to/3ZegyrS) is by my friend, Val, and is a sweet, life-a-flap book that reminds us that the best gift we receive at Christmas is Jesus. The classic [*Little Blue Truck's Christmas*](https://amzn.to/3VfEaLm) has been a years-long favorite thanks to the fun rhymes and light-up feature at the end. Finally, I bought [*How the Grinch Stole Christmas*](https://amzn.to/3B7ZQlP) for my kids this year, and they've read it no-less than 15 times in about 4 days.

## Christian Board Books

These books are technically gifts for the babies, but they're also really great tools to help parents begin intentionally teaching their children about God, the Bible, missions, and more. The [Baby Believer series](https://amzn.to/4fTqbmT) is great for babies to 2 year olds, while [my book](https://amzn.to/3ZIyw7n) and the toddler theology series (check the other books out [here](https://amzn.to/4ieKZ9M), [here](https://amzn.to/3VjwHL8), and [here](https://amzn.to/3ZegbgY)) are more suited for ages 2 and up (though that doesn't mean you can't start at infancy with these, too!). For another option, check out [*God is Great, God is Good*](https://amzn.to/3Vk0hAx) by my friend and former professor, D. Scott Hildreth.

(And I realize it's a bit self-serving to include my own book here, but I do believe it's a helpful book to start teaching your kids about missions! For more kids' books specifically about missions, [check out this article](https://www.meredithcook.net/resources-for-teaching-kids-about-missions).)

## General Board Books

    <a href="https://amzn.to/418bGXM" target="blank"><img src="/images/firstwords.jpg"></a>
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3Oy6apZ" target="blank"><img src="/images/dada.jpg"></a>

The [BabyLit](https://amzn.to/4iiqSri) series of board books are fun primers based on classic literature such as *The Wizard of Oz*, *Sherlock Holmes*, *Pride and Prejudice*, and many more. Fun fact- the illustrator for *Little Women* also illustrated my book. We had many of these when my kids were babies and they loved them. *First 100 Words* was also a longtime favorite, so much so that ours completely fell apart. We owned the large version (linked above) and [small version](https://amzn.to/4eW11m3). Obviously the small version works better for little hands (making it a good car book), but the large version was easier to read and seemed to draw their attention more. Finally, all the [Jimmy Fallon board books](https://amzn.to/41dvmtm) were much beloved by kids and adults alike in our home, so they are also a frequent baby shower gift. 

## Interactive Books for Young Kids

Interactive books are always great gifts since they might not be something you'd purchase when there's not a special occasion. My kids loved [*Press Here*](https://amzn.to/3AZifBo) and as a bonus for the parent, it sneakily teaches kids how to follow step-by-step instructions. Seek-and-find books ([here](https://amzn.to/49kKHdK) is the Christmas version of the one above) are a great gift and there are so many different options for various age groups (check [here](https://amzn.to/3ZxRspb) and [here](https://amzn.to/3Oy8Tj0) for a couple other versions.) Finally, we recently discovered *Kit and Kaboodle* books (check out [all the Highlights puzzle readers](https://amzn.to/4ieSsFQ)) and my son is particularly obsessed with them. These are more challenging for older toddlers and also help with sight words.
