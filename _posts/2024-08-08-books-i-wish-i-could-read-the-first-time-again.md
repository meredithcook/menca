There's just something about a Really Good book or movie that gives me such joy that I wish could read or watch it for the very first time again. In recent memory, *Top Gun: Maverick* was that movie for me. There is a long list of books that fit this bill, too. (And yes, there may be a kids' book or two on here as well.) Here are a few:

  <br>Daniel Nayeri
  <br>Levine Querido, 2020
  <br>
  <br>This book seemed everywhere on my social media feeds about a year after it was published, so of course I had to give it a read. I honestly don't know if I've ever read anything like it. Nayeri wrote it from his own perspective when he was around 12 years old (I think), sharing stories from his childhood in Iran and his years spent as a refugee in Oklahoma. What was especially meaningful to me while reading this book was getting a firsthand look at a refugee's experience. I've been friends with some refugee families over the years, but because of the language barrier, was not ever really able to know their stories. While all refugee stories are different, it was still powerful to read Nayeri's story and think about all of my refugee friends who went through similar hardships.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4fAEwoB" target= "blank"><i>Sounding Joy</i></a>
  <br>Ellie Holcomb
  <br>B&H Kids, 2022
  <br>
  <br><i>Sounding Joy</i> has shown up on <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">this site</a> before, but I had to list it here, too. I've read so, so many good kids books but this one took me by surprise at how much the prose touched me, too. It's a beautifully written reminder of what God did for us at Christmas.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3MgcEIR" target= "blank"><i>Harry Potter</i> Series</a>
  <br>J.K. Rowling
  <br>Scholastic, Inc; 2009 (Box Set)
  <br>
  <br>I might take some flack for this one, but I loved these stories. I was in elementary school when the first <i>Harry Potter</i> was released, and remember it becoming widely popular when I reached middle school. However, though some in my Bible Belt community were concerned by the content, I simply wasn't interested in the content (also, I was and still am generally suspicious of or confused by major trendsâ€”looking at you Stanley cup). However, boredom and curiousity got the better of me a few years ago and I read all seven books in just a couple of months. I was surprised and delighted by the stories and would love to read them again.

  <br>Rosaria Butterfield
  <br>Crossway, 2018
  <br>
  <br>If you haven't read Rosaria Butterfield's book, <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eQjh1s" target= "blank"><i>The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert</i></a>, then I recommend starting with that one before reading <i>The Gospel Comes with a House Key</i> to give you some context into Butterfield's conversion story and motivations behind her writing a book on hospitality. This book significantly informed how I think about the use of my home in ministry.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/45ZjYl2" target= "blank"><i>Life Together: The Classic Exploration of Christian in Community</i></a>
  <br>Dietrich Bonhoeffer
  <br>HarperOne, 2009
  <br>
  <br>This one showed up on last month's book list, but it belongs on this list, too. I've read <i>Life Together</i> more than once, but I distinctly remember how impactful it was the first time I read it. I was a new seminary student and was, for the first time, truly learning about the importance of Christian community. There were quite a few quotes in this book that hit home!
