There's just something about a Really Good book or movie that gives me such joy that I wish could read or watch it for the very first time again. In recent memory, *Top Gun: Maverick* was that movie for me. There is a long list of books that fit this bill, too. (And yes, there may be a kids' book or two on here as well.) Here are a few:

  <br>Daniel Nayeri
  <br>Levine Querido, 2020
  <br>
  <br>This book seemed everywhere on my social media feeds about a year after it was published, so of course I had to give it a read. I honestly don't know if I've ever read anything like it. Nayeri wrote it from his own perspective when he was around 12 years old (I think), sharing stories from his childhood in Iran and his years spent as a refugee in Oklahoma. What was especially meaningful to me while reading this book was getting a firsthand look at a refugee's experience. I've been friends with some refugee families over the years, but because of the language barrier, was not ever really able to know their stories. While all refugee stories are different, it was still powerful to read Nayeri's story and think about all of my refugee friends who went through similar hardships.

  <br>
  <br><i>Sounding Joy</i> has shown up on <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">this site</a> before, but I had to list it here, too. I've read so, so many good kids books but this one took me by surprise at how much the prose touched me, too. It's a beautifully written reminder of what God did for us at Christmas.

  <br>
  <br>I might take some flack for this one, but I loved these stories. I was in elementary school when the first <i>Harry Potter</i> was released, and remember it becoming widely popular when I reached middle school. However, though some in my Bible Belt community were concerned by the content, I simply wasn't interested in the content. However, boredom and curiousity got the better of me a few years ago and I read all seven books in just a couple of months. I was surprised and delighted by the stories and would love to read them again.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3SX7t42" target= "blank"><i>Little Women</i></a>
  <br>Louisa Mae Alcott
  <br>1868
  <br>
  <br>One of my all-time favorite movies is the 90's Winona Ryder version of <i>Little Women</i>. My aunt showed me the movie when I was in elementary school and while I haven't kept count, I am sure I've watched it at least 100 times. I never read the book, though, until I picked it up a couple of years ago. I was skeptical that I'd make it through—I had started countless "classics" and never finished because I just can't hang with the writing style and old English. However, while <i>Little Women</i> may or may not be considered a classic, I absolutely loved the book. It had all the nostalgia, feel-good, tug-at-your heartstrings stories from the movie, but more. It was a joy to read and I couldn't wait to pick it up every night before I went to bed.

  <br>Dietrich Bonhoeffer
  <br>HarperOne, 2009
  <br>
  <br>This one showed up on last month's book list, but it belongs on this list, too. I've read <i>Life Together</i> more than once, but I distinctly remember how impactful it was the first time I read it. I was a new seminary student and was, for the first time, truly learning about the importance of Christian community. There were quite a few quotes in this book that hit home!
