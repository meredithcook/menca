There's just something about a Really Good book or movie that gives me such joy that I wish could read or watch it for the very first time again. In recent memory, *Top Gun: Maverick* was that movie for me. There is a long list of books that fit this bill, too. (And yes, there may be a kids' book or two on here as well.) Here are a few:

  <br>Daniel Nayeri
  <br>Levine Querido, 2020
  <br>
  <br>This book seemed everywhere on my social media feeds about a year after it was published, so of course I had to give it a read. I honestly don't know if I've ever read anything like it. Nayeri wrote it from his own perspective when he was around 12 years old (I think), sharing stories from his childhood in Iran and his years spent as a refugee in Oklahoma. What was especially meaningful to me while reading this book was getting a firsthand look at a refugee's experience. I've been friends with some refugee families over the years, but because of the language barrier, was not ever really able to know their stories. While all refugee stories are different, it was still powerful to read Nayeri's story and think about all of my refugee friends who went through similar hardships.

  <br><i>Sounding Joy</i> has shown up on <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/favorite-board-books">this site</a> before, but I had to list it here, too. I've read so, so many good kids books but this one took me by surprise at how much the prose touched me, too. It's a beautifully written reminder of what God did for us at Christmas.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/3LhL8tM" target= "blank"><i>Questioning Evangelism: Engaging People's Hearts the Way Jesus Did</i></a>
  <br>Randy Newman
  <br>Kregel Publications, 2015
  <br>
  <br>I've read a lot of books on evangelism, but this one was by far the most practical and helpful book about how to share the gospel with others. Newman helps the reader learn how to engage nonbelievers in conversations about Jesus, the Bible, and the Christian faith in a way that seems less intimidating than other evangelism methods. While no evangelism book will help us share the gospel if we're simply not willing to (I certainly do not share the gospel as much as I should), <i>Questioning Evangelism</i> is my go-to recommendation for people who are not sure where to start.

  <a href= "https://amzn.to/4bGgiGj" target= "blank"><i>The Gospel Comes with a House Key</i></a>
  <br>Rosaria Butterfield
  <br>Crossway, 2018
  <br>
  <br>If you haven't read Rosaria Butterfield's book, <a href= "https://amzn.to/4eQjh1s" target= "blank"><i>The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert</i></a>, then I recommend starting with that one before reading <i>The Gospel Comes with a House Key</i> to give you some context into Butterfield's conversion story and motivations behind her writing a book on hospitality. This book significantly informed how I think about the use of my home in ministry.

  <br>Donald S. Whitney
  <br>NavPress, 2024
  <br>
  <br>I read an earlier version of Whitney's book years ago and have recommended it countless times since. <i>Spiritual Disciplines for the Christian Life</i> really laid the foundation for my journey towards <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/climbing-the-slide">habit formation</a> and broadened my view of spiritual disciplines beyond Bible reading and prayer.
