In our few short years of parenting, we have read hundreds of books to our kids. Though both of our kids are almost past the target age of board books, we have kept most of them. Our kids still enjoy reading many of them, and our daughter is learning to read the simple words board books use. 

We've read a wide variety of board books, but there are certainly some favorites that we've read over and over again.
