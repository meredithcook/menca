When our kids were born, we wanted to promote reading to them from the very beginning. So, we started reading board books to them almost before they could hold their own heads up. In our few short years of parenting, we have read hundreds of books to our kids. It seems to have paid off, so far. Both of our kids love books. Though our kids are almost past the target age of board books, they still enjoy reading many of their favorites. In fact, now that our daughter is starting to learn how to read, we find that board books are a great tool to help her with that. Because of their simplicity, she is starting to recognize and read many of the words in the books she's loved since infancy. 

I also love buying board books for friends who are having babies. We have many favorites, and I enjoy sharing them with new parents. Because of this, I thought I would share some of our favorites here, in case you or someone you know is looking for a good book to read to your baby or gift to someone else. (And, yes, it's also a self-serving way to remind you that <a href= "https://amzn.to/3uwAqdK" target= "blank">my board book is now available for pre-order.</a>)

Below is a list of our favorite board books. The criteria I used for this list boiled down to two things: the books my kids liked best and the books that I didn't mind reading 2413 times (seriously, we had to buy a new copy of several of these because we read them so much they completely fell apart). The books pictured below all made the cut, along with a few bonus suggestions included below.

<p>*Sounding Joy* is by far my favorite in this list. My kids think I'm nuts because I can't get through it without crying. Yes, it's a Christmas book and we don't typically read it year-round. However, the lyrics (<a href= "https://youtu.be/jthLvNgmFjA?si=RLjdXij_yHSIhNFE" target= "blank">it's got a corresponding song</a>) combined with the beautiful illustrations put this one at the top of my list.</p>
