Y'all, I have no idea what happened to August. It was one of the more busy months on record for us, so I have a shorter list for you this month. Happy reading!

### [She Was a Global Superstar—And a World-Class Spy](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-starlet-spy?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us){:target="_blank"}

If it's a World War II story, I'm going to read it. This is a closer look at Josephine Baker, a famous entertainer who became a spy for the French Resistance.

### [Look and Live: Christ as the True Bronze Serpent](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/look-live-christ-true-bronze-serpent/){:target="_blank"}

The story of the bronze serpent in Numbers 21 is one of my favorite narratives in Scripture, for reasons I'd love to expound on in a future post. This article elaborates on how Christ is the true bronze serpent, upon whom we look and truly live. 

### ["Because We're Christians, Kids"](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/because-were-christians-kids/){:target="_blank"}

I have thought a lot about this article since reading it this month, particularly when I'm trying to correct my children when they act unkind or disrespectful. Even though my kids are not believers yet, I always want to point my kids to the gospel when I'm instructing or correcting them. My prayer is that as they grow, the Lord will save them and the Bible and the gospel will become the foundation for all of their conduct. But I also know it's up to me and my husband to help them understand that context and why we live the way that we do.

<i>If the “because we’re Christians” answer is only related to things we don’t do, then I worry the kind of spiritual formation at work is one of negation, not missional living.</i>

### [Heart Medium: The Precedent for Digital Media in Missions](https://www.theupstreamcollective.org/post/heart-medium-the-precedent-for-digital-media-in-missions){:target="_blank"}

Missionaries are using digital media to communicate in people's preferred ways of learning and living. They are tapping into their audience's heart medium, just like earlier missionaries did with heart languages. By embracing digital media, missionaries are connecting with people and continuing a legacy of effective communication.

### [The Brief Rise and Steep Fall of a New Orleans Amusement Park](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/abandoned-america-new-orleans-six-flags-jazzland?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us){:target="_blank"}
Matthew Christopher
<br>Atlas Obscura

I'm so fascinated by abandoned places, and this article hit a little close to home. Six months after we moved to Houston, Hurricane Harvey hit the city and I witnessed firsthand the devastation and just how long it can take to rebuild. The remnants of Six Flags in New Orleans are a reminder of the tragedy of natural disasters.

### [Considering Self-Assessment](https://www.biblicalcounselingcoalition.org/2024/08/07/considering-self-assessment/){:target="_blank"}
Andrew Dealy
<br>Biblical Counseling Coalition

We often look inward to understand ourselves, but Scripture teaches that only God sees us accurately. Tools like the Bible, prayer, and the church help us gain a clearer understanding of ourselves through God's perspective. It is only by examining ourselves through God's lens that we can overcome sin.

<i>Jeremiah 17:9-10 counsels us that the heart is deceitful and sick, and the Lord is the only one who can make sense of it.</i>

### [Emma Carey: The skydiver who survived a 14,000-foot fall](https://www.espn.com/espnw/story/_/id/40422023/the-skydiver-survived-14000-foot-fall?utm_source=pocket-newtab-en-us){:target="_blank"}

This story is nuts. Emma Carey survived falling 14,000 feet in a skydiving incident, and this article recounts her journey to recovery, forgiveness, and finding joy in life again.

## Book Finished This Month

### [*The Worry-Free Parent*](hhttps://amzn.to/3AIk4Ce){:target="_blank"}
Sissy Goff
<br>Bethany House Publishers, 2023

I have read and listened to a lot of Sissy Goff's books and podcasts, and always find her counsel so helpful. A more in-depth review is coming, but I highly recommend this book.
