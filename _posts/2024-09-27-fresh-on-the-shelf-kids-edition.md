I'm starting something new, but sporadic, on the blog today. While I don't keep up with new books very often, every once in a while I will have new books to share with you. Today is one such day, and I'm excited to share three new kids books with you. (Disclaimer: both of these authors are friends of mine, so while these aren't full, unbiased reviews, I have read all three books and can vouch for them!)

# *God is Great, God is Good*

Written by D. Scott Hildreth, *God is Great, God is Good*(https://amzn.to/4dogTgB){:target="_blank"} takes a simple prayer so many of us grew up reciting and compels us to teach it to our kids in a way that helps them deeply consider the meaning of words they are praying. With a young narrator, vibrant illustrations, and Scripture references, Scott has created a book that encourages young and old readers alike to consider God's goodness, sovereignty, majesty and everything in between. *God is Great* reminds kids (and their parents) that God is good no matter what, and helps us all consider how we can give thanks to Him in all circumstances.

# *Toddler Theology Series*

[*Who is God?*](https://amzn.to/3ZB9MOB){:target="_blank"} and *What's the Good News?*(https://amzn.to/3BmdUIc){:target="_blank"} are the first two in what I hope is a long series of books that simplify theological concepts for toddlers. When my kids were younger, I was interested in doing simple catechisms with them, but felt overwhelmed by the options available at the time. Lauren Groves has written two books that I wish I'd had several years ago. Each book is written in an accessible, question-and-answer format that help kids remember biblical truth about God and the gospel.
