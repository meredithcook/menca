Hello! My name is Meredith Cook.

I am married to <a href="https://keelancook.com" target="_blank">Keelan</a> and a [stay-at-home-working mom](https://www.meredithcook.net/the-stay-at-home-full-time-working-mom) of two tiny redheads. Originally from South Carolina, I now call North Carolina home. After living in Houston for almost five years, I sometimes pretend I'm really from Texas.  

I serve as the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I earned a Master of Divinity in Missiology. I am also the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/45wlDh1" target="_blank">*Go Tell Everyone: 9 Missionaries Who Shared the Good News*</a>, a children's board book about [the Great Commission and missionaries](https://www.meredithcook.net/writing-a-children-book). Published by B&H Kids, *Go Tell Everyone* is scheduled to release on March 12, 2024. 

Before grant writing, I was a content editor and writer for various missions organizations, including the International Mission Board and the Upstream Collective. You can find my past articles at <a href="https://www.imb.org/?s=meredith+cook&sort=relevant&filter_type=post%2Carticles" target="_blank">IMB</a>, <a href="https://www.theupstreamcollective.org/post/use-the-holidays-to-your-evangelistic-advantage" target="_blank">Upstream Collective</a>, <a href="https://research.lifeway.com/2020/03/31/why-our-worship-and-spiritual-walk-needs-repetition/" target="_blank">Lifeway Research</a>, the <a href="https://cfc.sebts.edu/faith-and-work/women-seminary-professors/" target="_blank">Center for Faith and Culture blog</a> at SEBTS, and my <a href="https://keelancook.com/2016/04/29/your-churchs-continued-responsibility-for-its-sent-ones/" target="_blank">husband's blog</a>. 

Most of the articles on this site are introspections on how to live as a Christian in each season of life. As I fumble my way around, I desire to share what I'm learning in case it may help you, too. Right now, I write a lot about parenting toddlers, habit formation, and stewardship. I will regularly share <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#resources" target="blank">lists of good articles, my favorite books, and book reviews.</a> 

When I'm not supplying my kids with snacks, taking them to the playground, or requesting large sums of money from foundations, I enjoy drinking too much coffee, hiking with my family, hosting friends for dinner, reading, and baking. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/meredithcook716" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where I occasionally interrupt your timeline with really boring tweets. 

Thanks for stopping by!
