Hello! My name is Meredith Cook.

I am married to <a href="https://keelancook.com" target="_blank">Keelan</a> and a [stay-at-home-working mom](https://meredithcook.net/2022/05/30/the-stay-at-home-full-time-working-mom/) of two tiny redheads. Originally from South Carolina, I now call North Carolina home. After living in Houston for almost five years, I sometimes pretend I'm really from Texas.  

I serve as the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I earned a Master of Divinity in Missiology. I am also the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/45wlDh1" target="_blank">*Go Tell Everyone: 9 Missionaries Who Shared the Good News*</a>, a children's board book about [the Great Commission and missionaries](https://meredithcook.net/2022/10/18/writing-a-children-book/). Published by <a href="https://www.bhpublishinggroup.com/product/go-tell-everyone/" target="_blank">B&H Kids</a>, *Go Tell Everyone* is scheduled to release in March 2024. 

Before grant writing, I was a content editor and writer for various missions organizations, including the International Mission Board and the Upstream Collective. My current writing consists of articles for this site (you might want to read those) and grant proposals (you probably don't want to read those). You can find my past articles at <a href="https://www.imb.org/?s=meredith+cook&sort=relevant&filter_type=post%2Carticles" target="_blank">IMB</a>, <a href="https://www.theupstreamcollective.org/post/use-the-holidays-to-your-evangelistic-advantage" target="_blank">Upstream Collective</a>, <a href="https://research.lifeway.com/2020/03/31/why-our-worship-and-spiritual-walk-needs-repetition/" target="_blank">Lifeway Research</a>, the <a href="https://cfc.sebts.edu/faith-and-work/women-seminary-professors/" target="_blank">Center for Faith and Culture blog</a> at SEBTS, and my <a href="https://keelancook.com/2016/04/29/your-churchs-continued-responsibility-for-its-sent-ones/" target="_blank">husband's blog</a>. 

Now, I write mostly on lessons I'm learning about parenting, habit formation, and the general Christian life. Along the way, I may also share articles, videos, and other things I find helpful. 

When I'm not supplying my kids with snacks, taking them to the playground, or requesting large sums of money from foundations, I enjoy copious amounts of coffee, hiking with my family, having people in my house, reading, and baking. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/meredithcook716" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where I occasionally interrupt your timeline with really boring tweets. 

Thanks for stopping by!
