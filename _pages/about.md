Hello! My name is Meredith Cook.

I am married to [Keelan](https://keelancook.com){:target="_blank"} and a [stay-at-home-working mom](https://www.meredithcook.net/the-stay-at-home-full-time-working-mom) of two tiny redheads. Originally from South Carolina, I now call North Carolina home. After living in Houston for almost five years, I sometimes pretend I'm really from Texas.  

I serve as the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I earned a Master of Divinity in Missiology. I am also the author of [*Go Tell Everyone: 9 Missionaries Who Shared the Good News*](https://amzn.to/45wlDh1){:target="_blank"}, a children's board book about [the Great Commission and missionaries](https://www.meredithcook.net/writing-a-children-book), published by B&H Kids. 

Most of the articles on this site are introspections on how to live as a Christian in each season of life. As I fumble my way around, I desire to share what I'm learning in case it may help you, too. I will regularly share [lists of good articles and books](https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#resources), with the occasional [book review](https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#book-review) thrown in.

When I'm not supplying my kids with snacks, taking them to the playground, or requesting large sums of money from foundations, I enjoy drinking too much coffee, hiking with my family, hosting friends for dinner, reading, and baking. You can also find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meredithcook716){:target="_blank"}, where I occasionally interrupt your timeline with really boring tweets.
