Hello! My name is Meredith Cook.

I am married to <a href="https://keelancook.com" target="_blank">Keelan</a> and a [stay-at-home-working mom](https://www.meredithcook.net/the-stay-at-home-full-time-working-mom) of two tiny redheads. Originally from South Carolina, I now call North Carolina home. After living in Houston for almost five years, I sometimes pretend I'm really from Texas.  

I serve as the Grant Coordinator for Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, where I earned a Master of Divinity in Missiology. I am also the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/45wlDh1" target="_blank">*Go Tell Everyone: 9 Missionaries Who Shared the Good News*</a>, a children's board book about [the Great Commission and missionaries](https://www.meredithcook.net/writing-a-children-book), published by B&H Kids. 

Most of the articles on this site are introspections on how to live as a Christian in each season of life. As I fumble my way around, I desire to share what I'm learning in case it may help you, too. I will regularly share <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#resources">lists of good articles, my favorite books,</a> and <a href= "https://www.meredithcook.net/tags/#book-review">book reviews.</a>

When I'm not supplying my kids with snacks, taking them to the playground, or requesting large sums of money from foundations, I enjoy drinking too much coffee, hiking with my family, hosting friends for dinner, reading, and baking. You can also find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/meredithcook716" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where I occasionally interrupt your timeline with really boring tweets.
